# spartan-ecdsa

Efficient in-browser zero-knowledge ECDSA membership proving

## What we use

**Spartan**

- We use a fork of Spartan that operates over the secq256k1 curve.

**Nova-Scotia**

- We use a fork of Nova-Scotia to compile Circom circuits into a binary format that Spartan can process. We slightly modify Nova-Scotia to be compatible with secq256k1.

## About proving

**Witness generation**

- We use the wasm witness generator generated by Circom to compute the witness. More specifically, the witness generation is done by running `snarkJs.wtns.calculate` (the actual code [here](https://github.com/personaelabs/spartan-ecdsa/blob/bdc0ce4a5aa75934b9ca604b1cac9dbfc51d0134/packages/browser_benchmark/lib/prover/spartan.ts#L4)).

**Proof generation**

- The prover is a SpartanNIZK prover in wasm, which reads a circuit compiled by Nova-Scotia.
